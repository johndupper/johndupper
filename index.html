                <p>my head was spinning. did i make a good decision? do i really know what i want? was this a good idea? i reached out to my friend <a class="project-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-bendelow-7b725bb8" target="_blank">kyle bendelow</a> - a brave pioneer who took the leap from retail to code a few months before i did and who, with encouragement, helped me to do the same. he had attended an ios bootcamp (and loved it) called:</p>

            <h3 class="school-name">mobile makers academy</h3>
            <p>i packed my bags and headed back to the windy city. i spent the next two months absorbing everything i could: object-oriented programming, variables, objects, data tables, apis, xcode, git, and more. the instructional staff (<a class="project-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donbora" target="_blank">don</a>, <a class="project-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fiaz-sami-b36700" target="_blank">fiaz</a>, and <a class="project-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benbueltmann" target="_blank">ben</a>) did an incredible job of being stewards of learning. upon graduation, i was hooked. i knew the wild west of programming was right for me.<br><br>i spent the next several months as part of their instructional staff. i loved being able to support others who made the decision to pursue programming. explaining concepts to others reinforced what i had just learned and my learning expanded under the mentorship of my fellow instructors.</p>

            <h3 class="school-name">what next?</h3>
            <p class="school-info">after working on some personal projects i decided to level-up my understanding and tackle something new. i found an interesting statistic online:</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <span>"employment of web developers is projected to grow 27 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. demand will be driven by the growing popularity of mobile devices and ecommerce."</span><br>

            </div>
            <p>i decided to take a stab at web development - every company has a website, right? who maintains it all?</p>
            <p>i had such a great experience at mobile makers that i started looking into web development bootcamps. now living in atlanta, i saw a name that sounded familiar: <a class="project-link" href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank">general assembly</a>.</p>
