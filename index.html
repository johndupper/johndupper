                        <p class="post-text">I'm going to be honest... This post is incredibly lackluster. I didn't build this website to write shitty posts, I promise. Just the opposite. I've built this website to apply the HTML, CSS &amp; jQuery I've been learning - but also to share my experience in learning programming step by step, concept by concept. Bear with me while I get this site up and running. I'll come back with witty and engaging posts about figuring out flexbox positioning, deciding whether to use pseudo-classes or jQuery to animate sections, and much much more.<br><br>Most importantly, thank you for being here. It means the world to me. Talk to you soon. : )

                    My head was spinning. Did I make a good decision? Do I really know what I want? Was this a good idea? I decided to stay close to home, close to what I "knew". I had spent three years around iOS and OSX at Apple - what sorcery makes that work? The answer lead me to...</p>

                <p class="school-info">I quickly realized I wasn’t creating a sustainable foundation in programming. What I needed was structured content, focused learning and someone to turn to when I felt like giving up. I found the perfect place: Mobile Makers Academy.</p>

                <p>I packed my bags and headed back to the Windy City. I spent the next two months absorbing everything I could: object-oriented programming, variables, objects, data tables, APIs, Xcode, Git, and more. The instructional staff (Don, Fiaz, Ben) did an incredible job of being stewards of learning. Upon graduation, I was hooked. I knew the wild west of programming was right for me.<br><br>I spent the next several months as part of their instructional staff. I loved being able to support others who made the decision to pursue programming. Explaining concepts to others reinforced what I had just learned and my learning expanded under the mentorship of my fellow instructors.</p>

                <p class="school-info">After working on some personal projects I decided to level-up my understanding and tackle something new. I found an interesting statistic online:</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <span>"Employment of web developers is projected to grow 27 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Demand will be driven by the growing popularity of mobile devices and ecommerce."</span>
