This is my personal website.

For this project, I have decided to try to keep all of my content on a single HTML page. In order to accomplish this, I am using jQuery to show/hide each section's content based on the navigation element selected.

This site is built with HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox) and jQuery 3.1.1.
